As an agency, I worked With four other members for our client named ThunderBoom Records, a record company with AI-powerd music and artists. \n\n My role on the team was to be the main developer. I decided to use Laravel as our framework to work with because it was a framework we worked in the last period, so everybody knew it and I wanted to get more experience with the framework. I had someone else do the login system for the app while I was doing the front-end back-end for the videos. In the end, we showed the product to the client and they liked it. I therefore wrote a manual on how the Web app works and how they can use it themselves.",

		"description": "For my internship with <a target='_blank' href='https://twopine.nl'>TwoPine Media</a> I had to oppurtunity to learn more about automated testing. This project started from a client that occasionally if everything was working fine on the website because they didn't have any orders. So this was manualy tested by the developers, so the question was: How can we test functions automaticly? So I reseacrched automated testing and found out about Jest and Cypress. I decided to use Cypress because it has a nice GUI that helps write tests. After A couple testcases I showed it to my manager and he liked it and asked me if it possible to let it automaticly run after every release. So with that in mind I asked the backend developer what he thought about it and he said it was possible by using a POST Request. With that info I created a REST API that added the test that needs to run in a queue so it can be tested by Cypress after a test is finished the data is saved in a Mongodb. I decided to make a queue because on the first dat the server crashed because of to many request from outside. So that gave me two problems to solve, the first problem was to make a white list where only the Ip's from TwoPine can use the API. The second problem was the overload, so I decided to make a queue so Cypress can run the tests one by one and not simultaneously. This was the perfect solution for those problems, with those problemes out of the way I had chosen to create a Slack bot that send a message when the test is done that also includes the status of the test. This was an easy task because of my experience with creating a Discord bot. <br></br> After creating the backend for the project it was time for the second part of the project. I created a design for a dashboard that needed to make everything visual for the developers. I created a design in Figma with multiple iterations, eventually a collegue of mine did the finishing touches. After the design was finished I started to code the dashboard. I decided to use NextJs because I wanted to learn more about it and I had some experience with React. I created a dashboard that shows the status of the tests and the results of the tests and all the errors there are so that the can easly been seen and fixed. <br></br> This project was a great learning experience for me, I learned a lot about automated testing with Cypress and building tests and extending my knowledge on how to build a REST API. Nextjs was also a good learning experience on working with react.",
